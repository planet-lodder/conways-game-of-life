Conway's **Game of Life** is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway "John Horton Conway") in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input from humans.

The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: _alive_ or _dead_.

## Practical applications

The Game of Life has found applications in various fields, including computer science, biology, and artificial life. It serves as an educational tool for understanding complex systems, and its beauty lies in the way order and complexity emerge from a set of elementary rules, highlighting the elegance and power of cellular automata in modeling real-world phenomena.
